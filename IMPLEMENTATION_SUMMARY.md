# Lambda Cron New Company Processor â€“ Migration Summary

## Goals Delivered
- Replaced the Mongo-backed data layer with REST integrations documented in `services.py`.
- Normalised the Lambda entry point to `lambda_handler.py` with shared event parsing and response structure.
- Preserved Jina-first, RapidAPI-fallback enrichment while routing persistence through the API client.
- Added build automation (`buildspec.yml`), refreshed deployment docs, and provided a smoke-test harness using mocks.

## Key Changes
- **Configuration & Clients**: Introduced `config/` package and `clients.ApiClient` for retry-aware HTTP access. All required environment variables now validate on cold start.
- **Data Access Layer**: Replaced `db.py` with `services.CompanyDataService`; each method lists the expected REST endpoint for backend implementation.
- **Processor & Handler**: `processor.NewCompanyProcessor` consumes the new service and centralised logging helpers. `lambda_handler.py` supports processing and provider comparison actions.
- **Tooling & Tests**: Added CodeBuild spec, cleaned dependencies, and reworked `test_local.py` to exercise the handler with mocked providers.

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Implement the documented API routes on the backend (`webpages.list-test-candidates`, `nodes.apply-company-enrichment`, etc.).
2. Provision the Lambda environment variables listed in `DEPLOYMENT.md` before deploying.
3. Replace the smoke harness mocks with integration tests once the backend endpoints are available.
